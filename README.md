**Color Predictor Using Spatial Transformer Networks (STN)**  
- Collecting data from the internet and then labeling it.
- Built a deep learning model to predict colors in images, leveraging Spatial Transformer Networks (STN) for dynamic feature localization and alignment.  
- Preprocessed image data to enhance model training and implemented STN to focus on relevant image regions, improving prediction accuracy.  
- Utilized frameworks like Pytorch for designing and training the neural network architecture.  
- Conducted experiments to evaluate the model's performance, achieving robust results on test data.  
- Demonstrated expertise in advanced deep learning techniques, particularly the application of STNs to improve neural network interpretability and    performance.
